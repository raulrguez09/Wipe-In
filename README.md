## Project of the subject of graphic systems

# **Summary**
Each practice team will develop a small graphic system of free choice, a small application in which the graphic content is a fundamental part. The application that they will design and implement will have the theme of their choice, but they must inform the teacher about it, so that its complexity can be assessed and an application with a difficulty in accordance with the subject can be agreed upon. The application will be made in Three.js and Javascript. Other libraries may be used as deemed necessary.

# **Chosen theme**
Finally we have developed an obstacle course game with the theme of the famous Walt Disney Pictures film 
"Monsters, Inc.

# **Play**
